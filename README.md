TokenWise: Real-Time Solana Token Intelligence Dashboard
üß† Project Overview
TokenWise is a real-time Solana Token Intelligence Dashboard designed to provide dynamic insights into a specific SPL token's ecosystem. It offers a comprehensive view of token holder distribution, real-time transaction activity, and wallet-specific analytics, built to demonstrate key concepts in blockchain data processing and real-time web applications.

‚ú® Features
Dashboard Analytics: Provides an aggregated overview of token activity, including total holders, transaction counts, and overall protocol usage.

Top Token Holders: Displays a list of the largest holders of the monitored SPL token, along with their balances and percentage of the total supply.

Real-Time Transaction Feed: Presents a live stream of token transactions, categorized by action type (buy/sell) and associated protocol, updating dynamically.

Wallet Analysis: Allows users to select a specific wallet from the top holders list to view its recent transaction history and its interaction with various protocols.

Live Monitoring Status: Visual indicator for WebSocket connection status and backend monitoring activity.

Start/Stop Monitoring: Controls to initiate or halt the backend's real-time data processing.

üöÄ Technical Architecture
TokenWise is built with a modern, asynchronous stack:

Backend:

FastAPI (Python): For building robust RESTful APIs and managing WebSocket connections.

Motor (AsyncIO MongoDB Driver): For asynchronous interaction with MongoDB.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for persisting token holder snapshots and transaction history.

aiohttp: For asynchronous HTTP requests to Solana RPC.

websockets: For real-time communication with the frontend.

Frontend:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building the user interface, leveraging functional components and hooks.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI styling.

Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

WebSockets API: For consuming real-time transaction updates from the backend.

üí° Design and Thought Process
The core design philosophy behind TokenWise was to demonstrate an end-to-end system for blockchain data monitoring, emphasizing real-time capabilities and data visualization.

Modular Backend: Separating concerns into API routes, WebSocket management, and data processing tasks (WalletManager) ensures maintainability and scalability.

Asynchronous Operations: Utilizing Python's asyncio and FastAPI's async capabilities for non-blocking I/O, crucial for handling concurrent requests and long-running monitoring tasks.

Real-Time User Experience: Implementing WebSockets was paramount to provide a dynamic and engaging real-time transaction feed, reflecting live blockchain activity (or its simulation).

Data Persistence: MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility and ability to store semi-structured blockchain data efficiently, allowing for historical querying and dashboard analytics.

Responsive Frontend: React and Tailwind CSS were selected for their component-based approach and utility-first styling, enabling a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly user interface.

üöß Assumptions and Trade-offs
During the development of TokenWise, several real-world constraints and design decisions were made, particularly regarding blockchain data acquisition:

Solana RPC Rate Limits:

Challenge: Fetching comprehensive blockchain data, especially using methods like getProgramAccounts (essential for discovering all token holders), is highly resource-intensive. Free/public Solana RPC endpoints (e.g., Alchemy's free tier) impose strict rate limits and compute unit restrictions. This often leads to 429 Too Many Requests errors and timeouts.

Trade-off & Approach: To ensure a functional demonstration of the dashboard's features despite these limitations, the following strategic decisions were made:

Initial Data Seeding: The "Top Token Holders" list is initially populated by running a seed_db.py script. This pre-populates the MongoDB database with sample data, guaranteeing that the dashboard has content to display from the start, bypassing the immediate RPC hurdle.

Mock Real-Time Transactions: The "Real-Time Transaction Feed" and subsequent wallet-specific transaction history are populated with mock transaction data generated periodically by the backend. This effectively demonstrates the WebSocket communication, real-time UI updates, and backend data processing pipeline without being dependent on a constant, high-volume stream of live RPC data, which is often unfeasible on free tiers.

RPC Call Resilience: The call_solana_rpc function in the backend includes retry logic with exponential backoff to handle transient network issues and soft rate limits, showcasing a robust approach to external API interactions. However, for heavily restricted calls like getProgramAccounts, it is configured to fail gracefully after a few attempts.

Full Blockchain Indexing Complexity:

Challenge: Building a production-grade, real-time blockchain indexer that parses all transaction instructions, identifies protocols, and maintains a comprehensive historical database from raw RPC data is a massive engineering undertaking.

Trade-off: This project focuses on demonstrating the application layer (dashboard, real-time feed, wallet analysis) and the architecture for handling such data, rather than building a full-fledged blockchain indexing solution from scratch. For a production environment, a dedicated blockchain data provider (like Helius, QuickNode, or self-hosting a highly optimized indexing solution) would be essential.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions and Dependencies
To run TokenWise locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

Node.js 14+

MongoDB instance (local or cloud-hosted like MongoDB Atlas)

1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file:
Create a file named .env in the backend directory and add your configuration. Replace the placeholder values with your actual MongoDB connection string and Alchemy RPC/WebSocket URLs.

MONGO_URL="YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING"
DB_NAME="tokenwise_db" # You can choose a different database name
SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://solana-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY"
SOLANA_WS_URL="wss://solana-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY"
TOKEN_CONTRACT="9BB6NFEcjBCtnNLFko2FqVQBq8HHM13kCyYcdQbgpump" # The token contract address to monitor

Note: For SOLANA_RPC_URL and SOLANA_WS_URL, it's highly recommended to use a dedicated provider like Alchemy or QuickNode to get your API keys. While the project is designed to work around free-tier limitations for demonstration, a dedicated key provides better stability.

Seed Initial Data:

Run the seeding script to populate your MongoDB with initial top token holders and some mock transaction data. This is crucial for the dashboard to display content immediately.

python seed_db.py

You should see messages indicating that sample holders and tracked wallets have been inserted/updated.

Run the Backend Server:

python server.py

The server will start on http://0.0.0.0:8000. You will see logs indicating wallet monitoring starting and mock transactions being generated.

2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install Node.js dependencies:

npm install
# OR
yarn install

Create a .env file:
Create a file named .env in the frontend directory. This tells React where your backend is running.

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000"

Run the Frontend Development Server:

npm start
# OR
yarn start

The frontend application will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

For convenience, sample JSON files are also provided in the sample_data/ directory.

üìà Future Improvements

Integrate with a Paid Blockchain Data API: Transition from mock data to real, comprehensive real-time transaction streams and historical data by integrating with a robust blockchain data provider (e.g., Helius, QuickNode) that offers advanced indexing and parsing capabilities.

Advanced Transaction Parsing: Implement more sophisticated logic to parse complex Solana transaction instructions (e.g., DeFi swaps, NFT mints/sales, liquidity pool changes) to provide richer insights beyond simple buys/sells.

Historical Data Visualization: Add interactive charts and graphs to visualize historical trends for token price, volume, holder growth over time, and protocol usage.

Alerting System: Develop a notification system (e.g., email, push notifications) for significant events, such as large whale transactions, sudden price movements, or unusual activity.

Multi-Token Support: Allow users to dynamically add and monitor multiple SPL token contracts through the UI.

User Authentication & Profiles: Implement a user authentication system to enable personalized dashboards, saved wallet lists, and custom alerts.

Performance Optimizations: Further optimize database queries, API responses, and frontend rendering for even smoother performance with larger datasets.
